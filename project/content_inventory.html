            <dt>Who is the intended audience?</dt>

            <dd>
                <p>The target market for this website is anyone who is interested in seeing and learning about Portland.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>What opportunity, problem, or issue does the client wants to address?</dt>

            <dd>
                <p>The client wants visitors to know they have more years experience and provide more complete tours than their competitors.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>What does the client want the site visitors to do?</dt>

            <dd>
                <p>The client wants the visitor to call, fill out a contact form, search information about the tours, and book a tour.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and why you think they are related. What did you like about those other websites? What did you not like?</dt>

            <dd>
                <p><a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com">Portlandwalkingtours.com</a> is a similar site that offers walking tours around Portland. One thing I like about the website is the upcoming tours schedule. What I don't like about the website is the outdated style and small, hard to read font.</p>
            </dd>

            <dd>
                <p><a href="https://www.travelportland.com/list/portland-walking-tours/">Travelportland.com</a> is another similar website that lets you book walking tours around Portland. I like that this site is fresh and updated. The colors, font, etc. are visually appealing and it's easy to read and navigate. It would be nice if the site was dynamic and the listed tours had a cleaner look.</p>

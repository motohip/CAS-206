            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
                    Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
                    dome that can be opened.</dd>
                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
                    gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and
                    a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
                    are located in the lodge.</dd>
                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
                    changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring
                    a flashlight and a sense of adventure&#x21;</dd>
